    <p>A deep ceramic bowl filled with steaming dark-golden broth. Thin, wavy noodles sit in the center, topped with two halves of a soft-boiled egg (glossy, jammy yolk), a couple of thin slices of braised chashu pork (or tofu for vegetarian), a handful of sliced green onions, a sheet of toasted nori tucked at the edge, a few bamboo shoots (menma), and a sprinkle of white sesame seeds. Steam rises; the surface has tiny droplets of flavored oil giving a slight sheen.</p>
