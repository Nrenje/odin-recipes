        <p>
            Basque Burnt Cheesecake is a crustless, caramelized cheesecake from San Sebastián, Spain. 
            It’s intentionally baked at a high temperature for a deeply browned, slightly bitter top and a creamy, custard-like center. 
            Simple yet elegant, it’s rich, fluffy, and irresistibly smooth — the perfect dessert for any occasion.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>Cheesecake Batter</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500 g cream cheese (softened)</li>
            <li>200 g granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>250 ml heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the Pan</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Butter (for greasing)</li>
            <li>Parliament paper (for lining the pan)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 220°C (425°F). Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan and line it with parchment paper, making sure the paper extends above the rim to hold the rising batter.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and sugar together until completely smooth and creamy, about 2–3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure even mixing.</li>
            <li>Pour in the heavy cream, vanilla extract, and salt. Continue mixing until smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Sift in the flour and gently whisk until just combined. Do not overmix, as this can affect the texture.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and tap it lightly on the counter to remove air bubbles.</li>
            <li>Bake for 45–55 minutes, until the top is deeply browned and the center is still slightly jiggly when shaken.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool completely in the pan. The cake will deflate slightly as it cools, creating its signature rustic look.</li>
            <li>Chill for at least 4 hours or overnight before slicing for the best texture. Serve slightly cold or at room temperature for a creamy, melt-in-your-mouth experience.</li>
        </ul>
