            Detroit-style pizza is a thick, rectangular deep-dish pizza known for its caramelized cheese crust and light, airy dough. 
            Topped with bubbling mozzarella, crispy pepperoni, and a rich tomato sauce added after baking, it delivers the perfect 
            balance of crunch, chew, and flavor — a true comfort food with attitude.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>For the Dough</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 ½ cups bread flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon instant yeast</li>
            <li>1 cup warm water</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the Sauce</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Pinch of red pepper flakes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the Toppings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups shredded low-moisture mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>15–20 slices pepperoni (optional)</li>
            <li>Olive oil for coating the pan</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Start by making the dough. In a large bowl, combine bread flour, salt, sugar, and instant yeast. Gradually add warm water and olive oil, stirring until a sticky dough forms. Knead gently for five to seven minutes until smooth and elastic. Lightly oil the dough, cover, and let it rise at room temperature for two to three hours, until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>While the dough rises, prepare the sauce. In a small saucepan, heat olive oil and sauté minced garlic for about thirty seconds. Add crushed tomatoes, sugar, oregano, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. Simmer gently for ten to fifteen minutes until thickened. Set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>Generously coat a 9×13-inch pan or deep baking dish with olive oil. Press the risen dough into the pan, stretching it evenly to the edges. Cover and let it rest for thirty to forty-five minutes until slightly puffy.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 250°C (480°F). Spread the mozzarella and Monterey Jack cheese evenly over the dough, making sure some cheese touches the pan’s edges to form the signature crispy crust. Layer pepperoni on top if using.</li>
            <li>Bake the pizza on the lowest oven rack for twelve to fifteen minutes, until the edges are golden and the cheese is bubbling. Once baked, spoon the warm tomato sauce in thick stripes across the top of the pizza. Let it rest for five minutes before loosening the sides with a spatula and transferring to a cutting board.</li>
            <li>Slice into squares and serve hot. The result is a beautifully golden, chewy, and crunchy pizza — a perfect fusion of crispy edges, soft interior, and rich tomato-cheese balance.</li>
        </ul>
