            <li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>1 tsp sake (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tsp sugar (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>1 tsp toasted sesame oil (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Oil (finishing)</h3>

            <li>1 tsp garlic oil or chili oil (optional, for extra aroma)</li>

            <li>2 portions fresh ramen noodles (or 180–220 g dried/wavy noodles)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>200–250 g chashu pork slices OR firm tofu (200 g, pan-seared)</li>
            <li>2 sheets nori (seaweed)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup bamboo shoots (menma), drained</li>
            <li>2 scallions, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1–2 tbsp corn kernels (optional)</li>
            <li>Sesame seeds, to taste</li>
            <li>Pickled ginger or chili paste (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To make the broth, use about 1.2 liters of water, one small onion cut in half, two cloves of smashed garlic, a one-inch piece of sliced ginger, and one roughly chopped carrot. Add a sheet of kombu and a few dried shiitake mushrooms if you want extra umami. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer over medium heat, removing the kombu just before it boils to prevent bitterness. Let it simmer for about thirty minutes, then strain out the solids and set aside the clear broth.</li>
            <li>For the tare, mix three tablespoons of soy sauce with one tablespoon of mirin, a teaspoon of sake if available, a teaspoon of sugar, and a teaspoon of toasted sesame oil. Stir well until the sugar dissolves. This concentrated mixture will form the flavorful base of your ramen.</li>
            <li>Next, prepare the soft-boiled eggs. Bring a pot of water to a boil, gently lower in two large eggs, and cook them for six to seven minutes. Transfer them immediately to an ice bath and peel once cool. If you’d like seasoned eggs, soak them for a few hours in a mixture of leftover tare and water.</li>
            <li>For the topping, use about two hundred and fifty grams of chashu pork or firm tofu. To make quick chashu, lightly salt and sear pork belly slices until golden on both sides, then simmer them in soy sauce, mirin, sugar, and water until glazed and tender. If using tofu, press out excess water, slice it, season with soy sauce and a pinch of sugar, and pan-sear until browned.</li>
            <li>Cook two portions of ramen noodles in boiling water until tender but slightly firm, usually two to four minutes depending on the type. Drain well but do not rinse, as the light starch helps the broth cling to the noodles.</li>
            <li>To assemble, place about one and a half tablespoons of tare in each bowl and pour in about three hundred milliliters of hot broth. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Add the noodles to the bowl and gently mix them into the broth. Arrange your toppings — slices of chashu or tofu, half a soft-boiled egg, bamboo shoots, sliced scallions, a sheet of nori, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately while steaming hot. The combination of savory soy broth, chewy noodles, and tender toppings creates a deeply satisfying, homemade ramen that’s rich in flavor yet light enough to enjoy anytime.</li>
